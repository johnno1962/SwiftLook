### SwiftLook.xcodeproj - a curated Xcode view of Swift Source

This project is a simple means to navigate the Swift source tree including the
compiler sources and Swift standard library. 

git clone in the same driectory as your swift sources after it has been built and it should 
index/compile and be navigable with option-click as you would a normal Xcode project. 

It is not intended to be a way to build Swift however and will fail to link.
