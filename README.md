## SwiftLook.xcodeproj - curated Xcode project for Swift Source

This project is a simple means to navigate the Swift source tree including the
compiler sources and Swift standard library. git clone alongside your swift
clone after it has been built and it should index/compile and be navigable
with option-click as you would a normal Xcode project. It is not however
a way to build Swift and fails to link. You should only build Swift using
the command outline in its project's README.md.
